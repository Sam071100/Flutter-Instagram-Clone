# Instagram_Clone

Hey, everyone. Here I will build the fully functional working instagram clone with the help of flutter and firebase. We will see the interaction of firestore database and manage the state of the App usng the BLoc architecture. BLoc is a state management library that allows us to separate our UI from our business logic. Understanding how to properly manage state is essential in building a production ready mobile App. We will aslo see topics such as keeping an maintable file structure, firebase authentications and cloud functions, navigations with named routes, asynchronous programming with streams and features, building our own custom widgets and more.
